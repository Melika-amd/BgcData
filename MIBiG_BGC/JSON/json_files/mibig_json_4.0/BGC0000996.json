A new paper includes the publication of a fragment that closed a genome sequencing gap within FtdB. Locus tags and protein ID comprising FtdB from N-C terminus: SSLG_04251, protein_id=ADJ54381.1,SSLG_04252. This is why there are two loci listed, which is technically incorrect. Only one locus but in GenBank as the sum of two accession numbers.","legacy_references":["pubmed:20547882"]}
