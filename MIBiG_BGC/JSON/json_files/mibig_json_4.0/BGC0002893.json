There was no locus given in the paper but there were two clusters involved with lasso peptides in teh annotated NCBI genomes on two different contains. I chose these coordinates because only one of the clusters also appeared in S. Iakyus which the paper said was the case for the cluster they were describing. Is on contig NZ_JNZY01000037.1"}
