This publication focuses on orfP and orfR -involved in the streptolidine moiety. The NMR studies to support the structure seem to only have been performed on all intermediates leading to streptolidine. From the BCRC collection website (https://catalog.bcrc.firdi.org.tw/BcrcContent?bid=12163), this strain is equivalent to ATCC 8664, which according to https://www.atcc.org/products/8664 and https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.179.22.6929-6936.1997 is a confirmed streptothricin producer. The BGC itself seems identical to the one in strain NBRC 12908 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.1040 BGC0000432)"}
